  		<p>I am co-founder and Android developer at&nbsp;<a href="http://impraise.com/">Impraise</a>. I am playing with the Android ecosystem since 2012,
        having fun developing apps &amp; small games for mobiles and tablets and always willing to test the newest libraries and SDKs!</p>

      <p>This blog will mainly focus on Android, from design and user experience to small tutorials, as well as talking about various open source project I build,
         contribute to, or enjoy using.</p>

      <p>Originally from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q2WOeUW9U" target="_blank">Lyon</a>, I studied in France at
         <a href="http://www.epitech.eu/" target="_blank">Epitech</a>&nbsp;where I learned various technologies (C,&nbsp;C++, web-based languages,
         kernel programming, etc) and worked for a web agency and a wind-farm company. In 2012, I spent one year in the lovely city of Jönköping, Sweden.
          I followed there the Master classes&nbsp;“Information Engineering and Management” and I never&nbsp;really came back home. After few months in Berlin
          and <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">a trimester in the Bay area</a>, I&nbsp;now live&nbsp;in Amsterdam since October 2014.</p>
