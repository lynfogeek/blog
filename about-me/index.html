  		<p>I am co-founder and a senior engineer at&nbsp;<a href="http://impraise.com/">Impraise</a>.
        I strive to build products that have a positive impact on their users, and to overcome countless of
        challenges with my team.
      </p>

      <p>This blog contains articles related to mobile development (which was my primary focus between 2012-2016),
        talks that I have given in meetup or conferences, and it may expand to people management, technical leadership,
        and backend / Elixir development.</p>

      <p>Originally from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q2WOeUW9U" target="_blank">Lyon</a>, I studied in France at
         <a href="http://www.epitech.eu/" target="_blank">Epitech</a>&nbsp;where I learned various technologies (C,&nbsp;C++, web-based languages,
         kernel programming, etc) and worked for a web agency and a wind-farm company. In 2012, I spent one year abroad in the city of Jönköping, Sweden.
          I followed there the Master classes&nbsp;“Information Engineering and Management” and I never&nbsp;really came back home. After few months in Berlin
          and <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">a summer in the Bay area</a>, I&nbsp;now live&nbsp;in Amsterdam since October 2014.</p>
