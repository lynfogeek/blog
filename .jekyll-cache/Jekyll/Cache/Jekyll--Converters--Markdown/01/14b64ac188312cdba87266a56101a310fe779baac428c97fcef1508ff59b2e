I"«<p>Last week I went to Berlin to attempt to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23droidconde">#DroidconDe</a> where I gave my first public talk. It was a great experience, slightly stressful but I got some good feedback afterward. And eh, I love to receive feedback.</p>

<p>This year the event was really well organized and 3 of the 4 stages were recorded and you can find all talks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9Pfzam3fFdeURdCGf1vlBrnMn3MxjvRS">on the Droidcon Berlin youtube channel</a>.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s my talk, entitled <strong>Build a Sign up flow that doesnâ€™t suck</strong> with tips to improve your sign up and login screens on Android.</p>
