I"Æ<p>Over its 4 first years, Impraiseâ€™s mobile applications have grown with various updates, refactoring and feature changes. While being a young startup allowed us to â€œmove fast and break thingsâ€, we grew to a stage where we had to invest more on testing, stability and future proof implementations.
We evaluated the pros and cons of various architectures &amp; frameworks, for both our Android and iOS applications.</p>

<p>Our goal was to find an Architecture:
â€“ Easily testable and maintainable
â€“ Easily adaptable to Android and iOS
â€“ Adoptable without massive refactoring needed
â€“ With an unidirectional flow of events</p>

<p>We adopted <code>Clean Swift</code> as a base for our iOS architecture, and adapted it to Android. In this talk, I share with Guilherme, our lead mobile developer, the similarities and differences of our implementations, as well as their advantages and drawbacks.</p>
