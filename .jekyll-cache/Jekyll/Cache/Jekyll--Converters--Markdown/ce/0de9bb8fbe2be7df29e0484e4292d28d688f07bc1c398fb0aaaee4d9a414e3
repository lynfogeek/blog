I"ª<p>Over its 4 first years, Impraiseâ€™s mobile applications have grown with various updates, refactoring and feature changes. While being a young startup allowed us to â€œmove fast and break thingsâ€, we grew to a stage where we had to invest more on testing, stability and future proof implementations.
We evaluated the pros and cons of various architectures &amp; frameworks, for both our Android and iOS applications.</p>
