Last week I went to Berlin to attempt to [#DroidconDe](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23droidconde) where I gave my first public talk. It was a great experience, slightly stressful but I got some good feedback afterward. And eh, I love to receive feedback.

This year the event was really well organized and 3 of the 4 stages were recorded and you can find all talks [on the Droidcon Berlin youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9Pfzam3fFdeURdCGf1vlBrnMn3MxjvRS).

Here's my talk, entitled **Build a Sign up flow that doesn't suck** with tips to improve your sign up and login screens on Android.
